## Overview

We investigate the generation and propagation of impulse waves on particle-laden water produced by the subaerial collapse of granular columns. Laboratory experiments were performed by releasing dense granular columns into water covered with a monolayer of buoyant particles. By systematically varying the column height, water depth, and particle size, we explored a wide parameter space, which was compared with prior studies on particle-free systems. The coupled particle–wave dynamics were found to strongly influence both the waveforms and the distribution of buoyant particles. Two distinct regions of high particle concentration emerged: a static accumulation near the collapsed grains that buttressed the pile, and a dynamic region traveling with the wave that suppressed breaking. A strong correlation between the maximum wave amplitude and the geometry of the collapsing column was identified and used to refine a predictive model. These laboratory-scale results demonstrate how buoyant surface layers modulate wave generation, offering new insight into impulse waves generated by glacier calving in pro-glacial fjords containing ice mélange.
